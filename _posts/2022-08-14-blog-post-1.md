Supervised by Prof. Yunhe Hou, I cooperated with Qinfei Long, Dr. Rong-Peng Liu, and Dr. Wenjie Liu to deal with the real-time P2P energy trading problem, which can be formulated as a spatio-temporally constrained stochastic optimization problem by considering ESS and the spatial physical network constraints.
