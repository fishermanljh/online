excerpt: '__Abstract:__ The fast neutron reactor, one of the promising generation-IV nuclear reactors, particularly requires its coolant to have a strong capacity of transferring heat allied with a weak ability of moderating neutrons, and thus a new scheme of applying the dispersed flow as the coolant is presented in this study.
